# A temporary fix for resolver setup on Fedora > 33
#
# Updated F33 and newer have a systemd-resolved package
# with no backup DNS server configured. At the same time F33
# and newer have nsswitch set up to prioritize "resolve", and
# query "dns" (through '/etc/resolv.conf') only if resolved
# is not replying at all! 'cloud-init' can at this point in
# time (May 19th 2021) not handle resolvectl, but only edits
# 'resolv.conf' directly (which by default is just a link to
# resolved's stub configuration file).
#
# The end result is that resolved have no resolvers configured
# and will thus always fail. As it do respond the resolvers
# in 'resolv.conf' are never consulted.
#

# The resolver address is entered through puppet (from hieradata)

# Platform detection (borrowed from Omnitruck install script)
# Debian-family and RedHat-family are currently supported
# FIXME move platform detection to seperate file, use env var
